title: TypeScript as Data
description: How chant reads TypeScript source files as structured data
---

chant reads your TypeScript source files as structured data. It understands a specific subset of the language — the part that can be evaluated statically without executing code. This page documents exactly which patterns are supported and which are not.

## Supported Patterns

### Resource declarations

The core pattern: export a `const` binding initialized with `new _.ResourceType({...})`.

```typescript
import * as _ from "./_";

export const store = new _.StorageType({
  name: "my-data",
  versioned: true,
});
```

The evaluator extracts the export name (`store`), resolves the resource type from the lexicon, and evaluates the constructor argument.

### Literal values

Strings, numbers, booleans, `null`, arrays, and nested object literals are evaluated directly.

```typescript
export const service = new _.ServiceType({
  name: "handler",
  timeout: 30,
  memorySize: 128,
  environment: {
    variables: {
      DEBUG: "false",
    },
  },
});
```

### Const variable references

`const` bindings with literal initializers can be referenced by name. The evaluator traces the reference to its initializer and evaluates it.

```typescript
const tags = { project: "myapp", env: "prod" };

export const store = new _.StorageType({
  name: "data",
  tags: tags,
});
```

Only `const` bindings are supported. `let` and `var` are mutable and cannot be statically traced.

### Spread from const sources

Object spread is supported when the source is a `const` binding with a known literal value.

```typescript
const defaults = { timeout: 30, memorySize: 128 };

export const service = new _.ServiceType({
  ...defaults,
  name: "handler",
});
```

### Import and re-export

Standard `import` statements are followed through the module graph. The evaluator resolves imported names to their definitions in other files.

```typescript
import { sharedTags } from "./shared";
import * as _ from "./_";

export const store = new _.StorageType({
  name: "data",
  tags: sharedTags,
});
```

### Barrel references

The `$` symbol table provides directory-scoped access to sibling resource exports. See [Barrel Files & the $ Symbol](/chant/concepts/barrels/) for the full explanation.

```typescript
import * as _ from "./_";

export const service = new _.ServiceType({
  environment: {
    variables: {
      TABLE_ARN: _.$.dataTable.arn,
    },
  },
});
```

### Intrinsic tagged templates

Lexicons can register tagged template literals for provider-specific intrinsics (e.g., string substitution with deploy-time values):

```typescript
export const store = new _.StorageType({
  name: _.Intrinsic`${_.Params.StackName}-data`,
});
```

See your lexicon's documentation for available intrinsics.

### Typed property-kind constructors

Sub-resource properties can use typed constructors for autocompletion and validation:

```typescript
export const config = new _.EncryptionConfig({
  algorithm: "AES256",
});

export const access = new _.AccessConfig({
  publicAccess: false,
});
```

### Nullish coalescing for defaults

The `??` operator is supported for providing default values, particularly useful in composite props.

```typescript
timeout: props.timeout ?? 30,
```

## Unsupported Patterns

The following patterns are caught by the evaluability lint rules (EVL) before the evaluator runs. Your editor shows these as lint errors, and `npx chant lint` reports them in CI.

### Function calls as values

```typescript
// EVL001: Expression not statically evaluable
export const store = new _.StorageType({
  name: getName(),  // function call — not a literal
});
```

### Control flow around resources

```typescript
// EVL002: Resource inside control flow
if (env === "prod") {
  export const store = new _.StorageType({...});
}
```

Resources must be top-level exports. For environment-specific configuration, use separate files or composites with different prop values.

### Dynamic property access

```typescript
// EVL003: Dynamic property access
const name = config[key];
```

### Spread from dynamic sources

```typescript
// EVL004: Spread from non-const source
export const store = new _.StorageType({
  ...getDefaults(),
});
```

### Other unsupported patterns

- **`let`/`var` bindings** — only `const` is statically traceable
- **Class declarations** — `class MyStore extends StorageType {...}`
- **Template literals without known tags** — only lexicon-registered tags
- **Computed property names** — `{ [key]: value }`
- **`require()`** — only `import` statements
- **Top-level `await`**
- **Decorators**

For the full EVL rule reference with configuration options, see [Evaluability Rules](/chant/lint-rules/evaluability/).

## Why These Constraints?

The supported subset is the set of TypeScript patterns that can be evaluated without executing code — patterns where every value is either a literal, a reference to a known constant, or a symbolic cross-resource reference.

This makes the evaluator fast (no interpretation overhead), deterministic (same source always produces the same output), and auditable (every output value traces to a specific line in the source).
