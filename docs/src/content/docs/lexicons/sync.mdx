description: How lexicon type definitions and barrel declarations stay in sync
---

The sync mechanism keeps your project's type declarations in sync with installed lexicon packages.

## Lexicon Types

```bash
npx chant update
```

This syncs lexicon type definitions into `.chant/types/`, ensuring lexicon types are properly resolved.

Run `npx chant update` after:

- Installing or updating a lexicon package
- Cloning a project (`git clone` + `npm install` + `npx chant update`)

## Barrel Type Declarations

Barrel type declarations (`_.d.ts`) are now managed by **`chant lint --fix`** via the [COR016](/cli/lint/#cor016-stale-barrel-types) rule.

```bash
npx chant lint --fix
```

Run this after adding or removing resource files to regenerate `_.d.ts`. The lint rule detects stale or missing barrel type declarations and regenerates them when `--fix` is passed.

The generated `_.d.ts` files provide TypeScript with the shape of the `$` symbol table, enabling:

- Autocompletion for `$.` (lists all sibling resource exports)
- Type errors when referencing non-existent resources
- Go-to-definition navigation
