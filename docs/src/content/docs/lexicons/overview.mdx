description: How chant lexicons provide types and semantic rules for operational areas
---

A **lexicon** is a collection of types and semantic lint rules for an operational area. The core system is lexicon-agnostic — it discovers files, collects exports, resolves dependencies, and runs semantic lint rules. Each lexicon plugs into this pipeline with its own types and rules.

## Available Lexicons

| Lexicon | Package | Resources | Reference |
|---------|---------|-----------|-----------|
| AWS CloudFormation | `@intentius/chant-lexicon-aws` | 1500+ | [Reference](/chant/lexicons/aws/) |
| GitLab CI/CD | `@intentius/chant-lexicon-gitlab` | 3 resources, 13 properties | [Reference](/chant/lexicons/gitlab/) |

## What a Lexicon Provides

### Types

TypeScript definition files that describe available resource classes, their properties, and intrinsic functions. These types power editor autocompletion, inline documentation, and compile-time checks.

### Rules

Lint rules specific to the target ecosystem. These integrate with `chant lint` to catch provider-specific mistakes like invalid resource configurations or naming convention violations.

### Serialization

Each lexicon implements the Serializer interface to convert evaluated resources into the target platform's output format.

```typescript
interface Serializer {
  name: string;
  rulePrefix: string;
  serialize(entities: Map<string, Declarable>, outputs?: LexiconOutput[]): string;
}
```

## Bundles

A **bundle** is the distributable form of a lexicon — a `dist/` directory containing everything chant needs at build time:

| Artifact | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `manifest.json` | Lexicon metadata (name, version, intrinsics, pseudo-parameters) |
| `lexicon.json` | Resource registry mapping type names to definitions |
| `index.d.ts` | TypeScript declarations for all resource and property types |
| `rules/` | Lint rule implementations |
| `skills/` | AI assistant skill definitions |

When you install a lexicon package (e.g. `@intentius/chant-lexicon-aws`), the bundle is what ships inside it. Lexicon authors produce bundles with `chant dev publish`.

## Why Lexicons Exist

chant is provider-agnostic by design. The core handles parsing, module resolution, evaluation, and serialization — but knows nothing about specific infrastructure platforms.

Lexicons bridge this gap:

- **The core stays lean** — no bundled provider SDKs or type catalogs
- **Providers update independently** — new resource types ship as lexicon updates
- **Custom targets are first-class** — organizations can author internal lexicons
- **Projects declare exactly what they need** — explicit, reproducible dependencies
