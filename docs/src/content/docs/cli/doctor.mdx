## Synopsis

```
npx chant doctor [path]
```

## Description

`chant doctor` runs a series of health checks on your chant project and reports any issues. It verifies that your project structure, configuration, and type definitions are correctly set up.

## Checks

| Check | What it verifies |
|-------|-----------------|
| `config-exists` | `chant.config.ts` or `chant.config.json` exists and parses |
| `src-directory` | `src/` directory exists and contains `.ts` files |
| `core-types` | `.chant/types/core/` exists and is populated |
| `lexicon-types` | `.chant/types/lexicon-<name>/` exists for each configured lexicon |
| `lexicon-compat` | Lexicon manifest version is compatible with current chant version |
| `stale-dirs` | No orphaned `.chant/types/lexicon-*` directories for unconfigured lexicons |
| `tsconfig-paths` | `tsconfig.json` has `compilerOptions.paths` configured |
| `mcp-config` | `.mcp.json` exists with a `chant` server entry |
| `skills-<name>` | Lexicon skill files are installed in `.chant/skills/<name>/` |

## Usage

```bash
npx chant doctor

# Check a specific project
npx chant doctor ./my-infra
```

## Output

Each check reports one of:

- **OK** — check passed
- **WARN** — non-blocking issue found
- **FAIL** — blocking issue found

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | All checks passed (no failures, warnings are allowed) |
| 1 | One or more checks failed |
