description: Understanding and fixing TypeScript type errors in chant
---

chant uses the TypeScript type checker, so type errors are identical to what your IDE shows.

## Common Type Errors

### Wrong Property Type

```
src/bucket.ts:3:5 error Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'.
```

A resource property has the wrong type. Check the lexicon type definitions for the expected type.

### Missing Required Property

```
src/bucket.ts:2:1 error Property 'name' is missing in type '{ acl: string; }'.
```

Add the missing required property to the resource constructor.

### Invalid Property Name

```
src/bucket.ts:4:5 error Object literal may only specify known properties.
```

Check the property name casing. Lexicon types use the casing defined by the provider.

## Debugging Type Errors

Your editor provides the same diagnostics with hover information. To inspect lexicon type definitions:

1. Hover over a resource class and use "Go to Definition"
2. Review the property types and required fields

## Type Errors vs Lint Errors

| Prefix | Source | Example |
|--------|--------|---------|
| `TS####` | TypeScript type checker | `TS2322: Type 'number' is not assignable to type 'string'` |
| `EVL###` | Evaluability lint rules | `EVL001: expression not statically evaluable` |
| `COR###` | Correctness lint rules | `COR008: resource declaration must be exported` |

All three categories are reported by `npx chant lint` in a single pass.
