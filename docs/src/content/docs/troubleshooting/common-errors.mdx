## EVL001: Expression Not Statically Evaluable

A resource property contains a function call, method call, or other dynamic expression.

```
src/bucket.ts:5:3 error [EVL001] expression in property "name" is not statically evaluable
```

**Fix:** Replace dynamic expressions with literal values or `const` references.

## EVL002: Resource Inside Control Flow

A resource declaration is wrapped in `if`, `for`, `while`, `switch`, or `try`.

**Fix:** Move the resource to the top level. Use separate files for different environments.

## EVL003–EVL004

See [Evaluability Rules](/chant/lint-rules/evaluability/) for details on dynamic property access and non-const spread sources.

## EVL005: Block Body in resource() Callback

**Fix:** Use an expression body: `(props) => ({ ... })`.

## COR011: Circular Dependency

**Fix:** Restructure imports to break the cycle by extracting shared types into a separate file.

## Unknown Resource Type

The resource class isn't recognized by the installed lexicon.

**Fix:** Check for typos, then update the lexicon (`npm update`) and run `npx chant update` to sync lexicon types.
