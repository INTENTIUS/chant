## Missing Type Declarations

**Symptom:** Missing type declarations in your IDE, or import errors.

**Fix:**

```bash
# Sync lexicon type definitions
chant update
```

`chant update` syncs lexicon types into `.chant/types/`.

## Unknown Resource Type

**Symptom:** `Unknown resource type 'X'` error during build or lint.

**Cause:** The resource type isn't in the installed lexicon. Either the lexicon is outdated or there's a typo.

**Fix:**

1. Check for typos in the resource class name
2. Update the lexicon package: `npm update @intentius/chant-lexicon-<name>`
3. Run `chant update`

## No IDE Autocomplete

**Symptom:** Your editor doesn't provide autocomplete for resource properties.

**Fix:**

1. Run `chant update` then `chant lint --fix` to ensure types are generated
2. Verify `tsconfig.json` is configured correctly (see [TypeScript Configuration](/chant/configuration/tsconfig/))
3. Restart your editor's TypeScript language server
