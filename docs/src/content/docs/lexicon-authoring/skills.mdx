description: AI agent skill files contributed by lexicons
---

Lexicon authors can include skill files — markdown documents that teach AI agents how to work with the lexicon's resource types and patterns.

## Skill File Format

Each skill file is a markdown document with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
metadata:
  source: chant-lexicon
---
# Resource Authoring

When writing resources with chant and this lexicon:

1. Import types directly from the lexicon package
2. Use intrinsic functions for dynamic values
3. Reference other resources via direct imports
```

The `source: chant-lexicon` metadata marker identifies the skill as lexicon-contributed.

## Installation

Skills are installed automatically when you initialize a project:

```bash
chant init my-infra
```

## Lifecycle

- **Install**: `chant init` copies skills to `.chant/skills/`
- **Update**: `chant update` refreshes skills when a lexicon is updated

## Collecting Skills for Packaging

When building a lexicon bundle, use `collectSkills` from core to gather skill definitions:

```typescript
import { collectSkills } from "@intentius/chant/codegen/package";

const skills = collectSkills(myPlugin.skills());
```

This is passed to `packagePipeline` as part of the bundle configuration.

## Next Steps

With skills defined, the final step is to [package and publish](/chant/lexicon-authoring/package/) your lexicon.
