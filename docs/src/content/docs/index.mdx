import { Card, CardGrid } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Semantic Linting" icon="approve-check">
		Lint rules validate meaning, not structure. Rules operate on concepts like "resource has encryption" rather than cloud-specific property names.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Plain TypeScript" icon="puzzle">
		Declare operations as exported TypeScript objects — no DSL, no YAML, no decorators. Full type safety and IDE support.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Lexicons" icon="rocket">
		Each operational area is a lexicon. [AWS CloudFormation](/lexicons/aws/) ships today — 1500+ resources with full type coverage. Build your own for any operational area.
	</Card>
	<Card title="Composable" icon="document">
		Build reusable presets and composite resources with plain functions and the spread operator.
	</Card>
</CardGrid>
