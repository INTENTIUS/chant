description: What chant is and why it exists
---

chant is a TypeScript-first infrastructure tool. You define cloud resources as plain TypeScript objects, chant type-checks them against a provider lexicon, and emits deployment-ready output. No YAML, no string templating, no runtime execution.

```
TypeScript source → chant build → provider-specific output
```

You get real `import`/`export`, editor autocompletion, and semantic lint rules that catch misconfigurations before deployment — all in a single local pass.

## Choose Your Path

- **Use chant with AWS** — [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/), then the [AWS Examples](/lexicons/aws/examples/) for a real S3/IAM/Lambda walkthrough.
- **Create a lexicon** — [Philosophy](/concepts/philosophy/) for the design rationale, then [Lexicon Authoring](/lexicon-authoring/overview/) to build a plugin.
- **Contribute to chant** — [Development Setup](/contributing/development/), then the [Architecture Overview](/architecture/overview/).

If you're already using AWS CloudFormation, browse the [AWS lexicon reference](/lexicons/aws/) for intrinsic functions, composites, and examples.
