import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import barrelSrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/getting-started/src/_.ts?raw';
import defaultsSrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/getting-started/src/defaults.ts?raw';
import dataBucketSrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/getting-started/src/data-bucket.ts?raw';

## Step 1: Install chant

Install a lexicon for your target platform (this also installs chant):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @intentius/chant-lexicon-aws  # or another lexicon
```

The AWS lexicon gives you 1500+ typed CloudFormation resources, intrinsic functions like `Sub` and `Ref`, and pseudo-parameters — all with full editor autocompletion.

Verify it works:

```bash
npx chant --version
```

See [Installation](/chant/getting-started/installation/) for details.

## Step 2: Initialize a Project

```bash
npx chant init my-infra
cd my-infra
```

This scaffolds a project structure with a `chant.config.ts`, a barrel file (`src/_.ts`), and starter resources. The config file specifies which lexicon to use.

## Step 3: Sync Types

Generate barrel type declarations:

```bash
npx chant lint --fix
```

This generates `_.d.ts` files so your editor provides autocompletion and type-checking for resource properties.

## Step 4: Write Resources

The **barrel file** (`src/_.ts`) is the central import hub for your project. It re-exports everything from the lexicon and creates the `$` cross-resource proxy:

<Code code={barrelSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/_.ts" />

For the full barrel pattern — including `barrel()` and the `$` cross-resource proxy — see [Barrel Concepts](/chant/concepts/barrels/).

Shared defaults are regular exports that other files reference through `$`:

<Code code={defaultsSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/defaults.ts" />

Resource files reference types and siblings through the barrel:

<Code code={dataBucketSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/data-bucket.ts" />

Every property is typed — your editor autocompletes `bucketName`, `versioningConfiguration`, `sseAlgorithm`, and catches typos immediately. The `$` proxy resolves cross-file references like `$.versioningEnabled` at build time.

See the [AWS CloudFormation lexicon reference](/chant/lexicons/aws/) for intrinsic functions, composites, custom lint rules, and examples.

## Step 5: Build

```bash
npx chant build
```

The build command discovers all `.ts` files, collects exported declarables, resolves dependencies, and serializes to the target format.
