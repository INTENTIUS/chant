## Requirements

- **Bun >= 1.0** — chant uses Bun as its runtime. Install it from [bun.sh](https://bun.sh).

## npm

Install a lexicon for your target platform (this also installs chant):

```bash
npm install --save-dev @intentius/chant-lexicon-aws
```

See the [AWS lexicon reference](/chant/lexicons/aws/) for intrinsic functions, composites, and examples.

## Verify the Installation

After installing, confirm chant is available:

```bash
npx chant --version
```

You're ready to proceed to the [Quick Start](/chant/getting-started/quick-start/).
