description: Getting started with chant project configuration
---

chant projects use two configuration files at the project root.

## chant.config.ts

Controls lexicon declarations, linting rules, presets, per-file overrides, and plugins:

```typescript
import type { ChantConfig } from "@intentius/chant";

export default {
  lexicons: ["aws"],
} satisfies ChantConfig;
```

See [Config File Reference](/configuration/config-file/) for lint presets, rule overrides, and all configuration options.

## tsconfig.json

Standard TypeScript configuration for your project. Generated by `chant init` — you generally don't need to edit this. See [TypeScript Configuration](/configuration/tsconfig/) for details.
