description: Understanding the layout of a chant project
---

Running `chant init` creates a project layout designed to keep your resource definitions, type information, and configuration cleanly separated.

## Top-Level Layout

```
my-infra/
├── src/
│   ├── _.ts             # Barrel file — re-exports shared config
│   ├── index.ts         # Re-exports all source files
│   ├── config.ts        # Shared sub-resource configurations
│   ├── data-bucket.ts   # Data bucket resource
│   └── logs-bucket.ts   # Logs bucket resource
├── .chant/
│   ├── types/           # Generated type definitions (gitignored)
│   └── skills/          # Lexicon skill files (gitignored)
├── chant.config.ts      # Project configuration
├── tsconfig.json        # TypeScript config with chant path mappings
├── package.json
└── .gitignore
```

## Source Directory (`src/`)

This is where your resource definitions live. Every `.ts` file that exports values contributes resources to the evaluated output.

**`src/_.ts`** is a barrel file that re-exports shared config:

```typescript
export * from "./config";
```

This is a minimal barrel generated by `chant init`. For the full barrel pattern — including `barrel()` and the `$` cross-resource proxy — see [Barrel Concepts](/chant/concepts/barrels/).

**`src/config.ts`** defines shared configuration using typed sub-resource constructors. These are referenced from resource files via `import * as _ from "./_"`.

## Configuration Files

### `chant.config.ts`

Project-level settings for linting, lexicon declarations, and evaluation:

```typescript
import type { ChantConfig } from "@intentius/chant";

export default {
  lexicons: ["<lexicon-name>"],
} satisfies ChantConfig;
```

See [Config File Reference](/chant/configuration/config-file/) for all fields.

### `tsconfig.json`

Standard TypeScript configuration. You generally don't need to edit this file. See [TypeScript Configuration](/chant/configuration/tsconfig/) for details.
