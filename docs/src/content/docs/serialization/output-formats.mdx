description: How lexicons serialize evaluated resources into output formats
---

Each lexicon defines its own output format for serialized resources. The core evaluation pipeline produces a provider-agnostic resource graph; the lexicon's serializer converts this into the target platform's native format.

## How Serialization Works

1. **Evaluation** — chant resolves all TypeScript expressions, imports, and references into concrete values
2. **Property mapping** — Property names are converted from TypeScript conventions to the target format's conventions
3. **Output generation** — The lexicon serializer emits the final output

## Common Behaviors

All lexicon serializers share these behaviors:

- **Deterministic output** — Resources are serialized in a stable order, making output safe for version control and diff-based review
- **Null handling** — Properties set to `null` are omitted from output objects; `null` values inside arrays are preserved
- **Reference resolution** — Cross-resource references are converted to the target format's reference mechanism

See your lexicon's documentation for the specific output format.
