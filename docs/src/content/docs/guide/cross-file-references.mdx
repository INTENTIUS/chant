title: Cross-File References
description: How to reference resources defined in other files
---

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import storageSrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/core-concepts/src/cross-ref-storage.ts?raw';
import policySrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/core-concepts/src/cross-ref-policy.ts?raw';

Resources often depend on each other — a policy needs a storage resource's ARN, a function needs a table's name. chant uses standard TypeScript imports for cross-file references.

## Direct Imports

Import a resource from another file and access its attributes:

<Code code={storageSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/cross-ref-storage.ts" />

<Code code={policySrc} lang="typescript" title="src/cross-ref-policy.ts" />

`dataBucket.arn` resolves to a symbolic cross-resource reference in the evaluated output. The evaluator traces the import back to the source file, identifies the resource type, and resolves the attribute through the lexicon's attribute registry.

## Build-Time Resolution

Cross-file references are resolved at build time, not at runtime. This means:

- References are resolved statically — the evaluator follows imports to build the resource graph
- References to nonexistent resources produce a build error
- Circular dependencies between resources are detected and reported

## Importing Patterns

| Pattern | Example |
|---|---|
| Import a resource | `import { dataBucket } from "./data-bucket"` |
| Import shared config | `import { encryptionDefault } from "./defaults"` |
| Import from lexicon | `import { Bucket, Sub, AWS } from "@intentius/chant-lexicon-aws"` |
| Import from core | `import { Composite, output } from "@intentius/chant"` |

All imports use standard TypeScript `import` statements. The evaluator follows imports through the module graph and resolves each referenced binding to its definition.
