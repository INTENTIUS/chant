title: Using Barrel Files
description: How to use barrel files for sharing resources and types across files
---

Barrel files (`_.ts`) are the mechanism for sharing resources and types across files in a chant project. They re-export the lexicon and provide the `$` symbol table for cross-file references.

For a full explanation of how barrels work, see [Barrel Files & the $ Symbol](/chant/concepts/barrels/).

## Quick Reference

Create a barrel file at `src/_.ts`:

```typescript
export * from "@intentius/chant-lexicon-<name>";
import { barrel } from "@intentius/chant";
export const $ = barrel(import.meta.dir);
```

Import it in resource files:

```typescript
import * as _ from "./_";

export const myStore = new _.StorageType({
  name: "my-data",
  config: _.$.sharedDefaults,
});
```

- `_.*` — lexicon types, intrinsics, and pseudo-parameters
- `_.$.*` — sibling resource exports discovered automatically
