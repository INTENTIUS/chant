description: Synthesizing TypeScript resource definitions into deployment-ready output
---

Use `npx chant build` to synthesize your TypeScript resource definitions into deployment-ready output.

```bash
npx chant build                # Build from current directory
npx chant build ./infra        # Build from a specific path
npx chant build -o stack.json  # Output to file
npx chant build --format yaml  # YAML output
npx chant build --watch        # Re-run on file changes
```

See the [build CLI reference](/cli/build/) for full flag documentation.

## What Happens

The build command:

1. Discovers all `.ts` files in the specified path
2. Imports modules and collects declarable entities
3. Resolves attribute references and dependencies
4. Builds dependency graph and performs topological sort
5. Serializes to the lexicon-specific format
6. Outputs result to stdout or file

## Multi-file output

When your project uses child projects (e.g. nested stacks), the build may produce multiple output files. For example, the AWS lexicon's `nestedStack()` generates a parent template plus one child template per child project:

```bash
npx chant build -o template.json
# Produces:
#   template.json              — parent template
#   network.template.json      — child template (one per nestedStack)
```

All generated files are written alongside the primary output file. See [Multi-Stack Output](/serialization/multi-stack/) for details.

## Deployment

chant does not include a deployment engine. Use your target platform's tools to deploy the generated output. See your lexicon's documentation for provider-specific deployment examples.
