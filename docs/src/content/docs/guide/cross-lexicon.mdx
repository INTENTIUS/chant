title: Cross-Lexicon Projects
description: Combine multiple lexicons (e.g. AWS + GitLab) in a single chant project

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import barrelSrc from '../../../../../examples/gitlab-aws/src/_.ts?raw';
import pipelineSrc from '../../../../../examples/gitlab-aws/src/pipeline.ts?raw';

A cross-lexicon project uses **two or more lexicons** in one project — for example, AWS CloudFormation infrastructure alongside a GitLab CI pipeline that deploys to it. Chant auto-detects cross-lexicon references, generates the necessary outputs, and orders deployments correctly.

## Setup

Add both lexicons to `chant.config.json`:

```json
{
  "lexicons": ["aws", "gitlab"],
  "extends": ["@intentius/chant/lint/presets/strict"]
}
```

Install both lexicon packages:

```bash
bun add @intentius/chant-lexicon-aws @intentius/chant-lexicon-gitlab
```

## Barrel pattern with namespaced imports

When two lexicons might export the same name, namespace one of them:

<Code code={barrelSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/_.ts" />

AWS entities are imported flat (`_.Bucket`, `_.Role`) while GitLab entities are namespaced (`_.gl.Job`, `_.gl.Rule`).

## Cross-lexicon references

When a GitLab entity references an attribute from an AWS entity, chant automatically detects the **cross-lexicon AttrRef**:

<Code code={pipelineSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/pipeline.ts" />

Here `_.$.deployBucket.arn` is an `AttrRef` pointing to an AWS `Bucket` entity. Because the consuming entity (a GitLab `Job`) belongs to a different lexicon than the source entity (an AWS `Bucket`), chant:

1. **Adds an Output** to the AWS CloudFormation template (e.g. `Outputs.deployBucket_Arn`)
2. **Sets deploy order** to `["aws", "gitlab"]` — AWS deploys first so the output value is available

:::caution
The AttrRef must be a **direct property value** for the walker to detect it. Embedding it inside a JS template literal (`s3://${bucket.arn}`) coerces it to a string and loses the reference. Use a `variables` map instead.
:::

## Build output

`chant build` produces a multi-output result keyed by lexicon name:

```bash
chant build src
# Outputs JSON with both "aws" (CloudFormation) and "gitlab" (.gitlab-ci.yml) sections
```

The build manifest includes:
- `lexicons` — which lexicons are present
- `outputs` — auto-generated cross-lexicon outputs
- `deployOrder` — ordered list of lexicons to deploy

## Linting

Both lexicon rule sets run in a single `chant lint` invocation. AWS rules (WAW*) and GitLab rules (WGL*) are applied to their respective entities.

## Example
