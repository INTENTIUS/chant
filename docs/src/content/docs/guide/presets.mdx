title: Presets
description: Sharing default property values across resources
---

Presets are shared default values that you spread into resource definitions. They reduce repetition when multiple resources of the same type share common configuration.

## Defining a Preset

Extract shared properties into a `const` object:

```typescript
// src/defaults.ts
import * as _ from "./_";

export const secureDefaults = {
  encrypted: true,
  versioned: true,
  accessControl: "private",
};
```

## Using a Preset

Import and spread the preset into each resource, then add or override properties:

```typescript
// src/store-a.ts
import * as _ from "./_";

export const storeA = new _.StorageType({
  ..._.$.secureDefaults,
  name: "app-store-a",
});
```

Properties listed after the spread override the preset.

## Rules

- The spread source must be a `const` binding. Spreading from `let`, `var`, or function calls triggers lint rule EVL004.
- Preset objects are plain data — they are not resource instances.
- Properties in the spread are merged shallowly. Nested objects are replaced entirely, not deep-merged.

See your lexicon's documentation for working preset examples with concrete resource types.
