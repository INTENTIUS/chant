title: Presets
description: Sharing default property values across resources

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

import presetUsageSrc from '../../../../../lexicons/aws/examples/core-concepts/src/preset-usage.ts?raw';

Presets are shared default values that you reference from resource definitions. They reduce repetition when multiple resources of the same type share common configuration.

## Defining a Preset

Extract shared properties into exported `const` declarations:

<Code code={presetDefaultsSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/preset-defaults.ts" />

## Using a Preset

Reference the preset via the barrel and use it in resource properties:

<Code code={presetUsageSrc} lang="typescript" title="src/preset-usage.ts" />

Properties listed after the preset reference override the preset values.

## Rules

- The spread source must be a `const` binding. Spreading from `let`, `var`, or function calls triggers lint rule EVL004.
- Preset objects are plain data — they are not resource instances.
- Properties in the spread are merged shallowly. Nested objects are replaced entirely, not deep-merged.

See your lexicon's documentation for working preset examples with concrete resource types.
