Some lint rules provide structured fixes that can be applied automatically.

## Usage

```bash
npx chant lint --fix
```

When `--fix` is not set, fixable diagnostics are annotated with `[fixable]` in text output:

```
src/storage.ts:3:5 warning [COR005] [fixable] Exported names should be camelCase
```

`--fix` runs once and exits. In watch mode, fixes are applied on each re-run.

## Fixable Rules

| Rule | Fix Kind | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| COR002 | `replace-import` | Rewrites barrel imports to namespace syntax |
| COR005 | `rename` | Renames PascalCase exports to camelCase |
| COR006 | `replace-import` | Rewrites lexicon imports to namespace syntax |
| COR012 | `delete` | Removes redundant `import type` line |
| COR014 | `replace-import` | Rewrites direct lexicon import to barrel import (requires `_.ts`) |
| COR015 | TextEdit | Removes redundant `as Value<...>` cast |
| COR016 | `write-file` | Generates or regenerates `_.d.ts` barrel type declarations |
| COR017 | TextEdit | Inserts or replaces Composite name to match variable |
| EVL006 | TextEdit | Wraps barrel() in `export const $` |

## Examples

### COR005 — Naming Convention

```typescript
// Before
export const MyBucket = new _.Resource({ ... });

// After fix
export const myBucket = new _.Resource({ ... });
```

### COR002 — Barrel Import Style

```typescript
// Before
import { bucket } from "./_";

// After fix
import * as _ from "./_";
```

## How Fixes Are Applied

1. Diagnostics with available fixes are collected during the lint pass
2. Fixes are sorted in reverse source order (bottom-to-top) to preserve positions
3. Overlapping fixes are skipped to avoid conflicts
4. Each fix is applied to the source text and the file is written back
5. Lint is re-run to show remaining unfixable issues
