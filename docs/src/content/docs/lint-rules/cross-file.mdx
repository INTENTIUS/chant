title: Cross-File Rules
description: Rules that analyze the import graph across your project

Cross-file rules analyze the import graph across your entire project. They run after single-file analysis completes.

## COR010: Unused Exports

**Severity:** warning

Flags exported symbols that are never imported by any other file. Unused exports add dead code to your project.

```typescript
// storage.ts
export const bucket = new _.Resource({ ... });
export const unusedHelper = { key: "value" };
//           ~~~~~~~~~~~~ ⚠ COR010: 'unusedHelper' is exported but never imported
```

**Fix:** Remove the unused export, or convert it to a non-exported `const` if it's used locally.

## COR011: Circular Dependencies

**Severity:** error

Detects circular import chains between files. Circular dependencies prevent deterministic evaluation order.

```
error[COR011]: circular dependency detected
  ┌─ src/networking.ts
  │
  │   networking.ts → security.ts → compute.ts → networking.ts
```

**Fix:** Break the cycle by extracting shared declarations into a separate file.
