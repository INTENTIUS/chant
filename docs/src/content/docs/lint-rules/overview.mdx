title: Lint Rules Overview
description: Complete reference for chant semantic lint rules
---

chant includes a semantic lint system that validates the meaning of your declarations, not just their structure. Core rules (COR, EVL) apply to all projects. Each lexicon brings its own lexicon-specific rules.

## Rule Categories

| Category | ID Range | Scope | Description |
|----------|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Evaluability** | EVL001–EVL010 | Single file | Flag TypeScript patterns that cannot be statically evaluated |
| **Style** | COR001–COR009, COR012–COR016, COR018 | Single file | Structural and naming conventions |
| **Cross-File** | COR010–COR011 | Multi-file | Unused exports and circular dependencies |
| **Correctness** | COR003, COR004, COR007, COR008, COR016, COR017 | Single file | Structural errors |
| **Composite** | EVL009, EVL010, COR017, COR018 | Single file | Best practices for Composite() factories |
| **Lexicon** | Varies by lexicon | Varies | Provider-specific rules (see lexicon docs) |

## Severity Levels

- **error** — blocks the build. Must be fixed.
- **warning** — does not block the build. Should be addressed.
- **info** — informational. Highlights potential improvements.

Severity can be overridden per-rule in your configuration. See [Rule Configuration](/lint-rules/configuration/).

## Running the Linter

```bash
npx chant lint                   # Lint all files
npx chant lint --format json     # Machine-readable output
npx chant lint --format sarif    # SARIF 2.1.0 for CI integrations
npx chant lint --watch           # Watch for changes
npx chant lint --fix             # Auto-fix fixable issues
```

## Configuration

Rules are configured via `chant.config.ts` in your project root. When no config file is found, the **strict** preset is used by default.

### Built-in Presets

**Strict** (`@intentius/chant/lint/presets/strict`) — recommended for production:

| Rule | Severity |
|------|----------|
| COR001 | error |
| COR002 | error |
| COR003 | warning |
| COR004 | warning |
| COR005 | warning |
| COR006 | error |
| COR007 | warning |
| COR008 | error |
| COR009 | warning |
| COR010 | warning |
| COR011 | error |
| COR012 | warning |
| COR013 | info |
| COR014 | warning |
| COR015 | warning |
| COR016 | warning |
| COR017 | error |
| COR018 | info |
| EVL001–EVL008 | error |
| EVL009 | warning |
| EVL010 | warning |

**Relaxed** (`@intentius/chant/lint/presets/relaxed`) — for migration or prototyping. Disables most style rules and relaxes correctness rules to warnings.

### Inline Disable Directives

Suppress rules with comments:

```typescript
// chant-disable — disable all rules for entire file
// chant-disable COR001 COR006 — disable specific rules for file
// chant-disable-line — disable all rules for this line
// chant-disable-next-line COR001 — disable COR001 for next line
```

See [Disable Directives](/lint-rules/disable-directives/) for details.
