title: Rule Configuration
description: Configuring lint rule severities, presets, and overrides
---

Lint rules are configured in `chant.config.ts` under the `lint` key.

## Basic Configuration

```typescript
export default {
  lint: {
    rules: {
      "EVL001": "error",
      "COR004": "warning",
      "COR008": "off",
    },
  },
} satisfies ChantConfig;
```

## Severity Levels

| Severity | Effect |
|----------|--------|
| `"error"` | Fails the lint run (non-zero exit code) |
| `"warning"` | Reported but does not fail |
| `"info"` | Informational notice |
| `"off"` | Disables the rule entirely |

## Presets

Use `extends` to inherit rule configurations:

```typescript
export default {
  lint: {
    extends: ["@intentius/chant/lint/presets/strict"],
    rules: {
      "COR004": "off",  // override preset
    },
  },
} satisfies ChantConfig;
```

Presets are resolved recursively. Local rules override inherited ones.

## File-Specific Overrides

Apply different rule settings to specific file patterns:

```typescript
export default {
  lint: {
    rules: { "COR004": "warning" },
    overrides: [
      {
        files: ["src/legacy/**/*.ts"],
        rules: { "COR004": "off" },
      },
    ],
  },
} satisfies ChantConfig;
```

## Rule Options

Some rules accept an options object as the second element of a tuple:

```typescript
rules: {
  "COR009": ["warning", { max: 12 }],
}
```
