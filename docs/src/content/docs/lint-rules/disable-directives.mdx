title: Disable Directives
description: Suppressing specific lint diagnostics using comments
---

Suppress specific lint diagnostics using comments in your source files.

## Disable for Entire File

Place at the top of the file:

```typescript
// chant-disable COR005
// chant-disable
```

- `// chant-disable` — suppresses all rules for the entire file
- `// chant-disable COR005` — suppresses only COR005 for the entire file

## Disable for Current Line

```typescript
export const myBucket = new _.Resource({ // chant-disable-line COR005
  bucketName: "my-bucket",
});
```

## Disable for Next Line

```typescript
// chant-disable-next-line COR005
export const myBucket = new _.Resource({
  bucketName: "my-bucket",
});
```

## Block Comment Syntax

All directives also work with block comments:

```typescript
/* chant-disable-next-line COR010 */
export const helper = { key: "value" };
```

## Usage Guidelines

- Prefer the narrowest scope possible (`disable-next-line` over `disable`)
- Always specify the rule ID rather than suppressing all rules
- Use file-level `disable` sparingly — typically only for generated files
