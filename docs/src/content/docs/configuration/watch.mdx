title: Watch Mode
description: Automatic rebuilds and re-linting on file changes
---

chant includes a watch mode that monitors your source files and automatically re-runs on changes. Available on both `build` and `lint` commands.

## Usage

```bash
npx chant build --watch
npx chant lint --watch
```

## How It Works

1. **File system monitoring** — watches for file create, modify, and delete events
2. **Debouncing** — changes are batched with a short debounce window
3. **Dependency-aware re-runs** — only affected files (the changed file plus its dependents) are re-checked
4. **Full re-runs on structure changes** — file creations, deletions, and renames trigger a full re-run

## Watched and Ignored Paths

Watch mode monitors all `.ts` files, with these exclusions:

| Ignored Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `node_modules/` | Dependencies don't change during development |
| `.git/` | Version control metadata |
| `*.d.ts` | Type declaration files (generated) |
| Hidden directories (`.*/`) | Editor configs, tool caches |

## Tips

- **Large projects:** The dependency-aware rebuild keeps re-runs fast for localized changes
- **Terminal multiplexing:** Run watch mode in one terminal pane and your editor in another
