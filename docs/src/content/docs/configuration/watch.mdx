title: Watch Mode
description: Automatic rebuilds and re-linting on file changes
---

chant includes a watch mode that monitors your source files and automatically re-runs on changes. Available on both `build` and `lint` commands.

## Usage

```bash
chant build --watch
chant lint --watch
```

## How It Works

1. **File system monitoring** — watches for file create, modify, and delete events
2. **Debouncing** — changes are batched with a short debounce window
3. **Full re-runs** — each batch of changes triggers a full rebuild or re-lint

## Watched and Ignored Paths

Watch mode monitors all `.ts` files, with these exclusions:

| Ignored Pattern | Reason |
|---|---|
| `node_modules/` | Dependencies don't change during development |
| `.chant/` | Generated types and metadata |
| Hidden directories (`.*/`) | `.git/`, editor configs, tool caches |
| `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts` | Test files |
| Non-`.ts` files | Only `.ts` files are watched |

## Tips

- **Large projects:** Debouncing keeps re-runs efficient by batching rapid file saves
- **Terminal multiplexing:** Run watch mode in one terminal pane and your editor in another
